# Drug Response ML

This project predicts drug response using patient reviews and metadata.

## Goals
- Clean and preprocess raw medical review data
- Perform EDA on drug, condition, and sentiment patterns
- Build ML/NLP models to predict:
  - Rating
  - Response category (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Hugging Face (later for NLP models)

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for each stage
- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets
- `models/` – Trained models
- `reports/` – Results and visualizations

This repository will be updated continuously as the project evolves.
